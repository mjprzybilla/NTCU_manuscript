# FIGURE 2

This GitHub repository contains the files to reproduce experimental curves shown in Figure 2E,F and G.

Content:
```
└─ area_hole_cells.mat: corresponding to the area of voids (units of cells) obtained for the 3 conditions: two controls, and long term NTCU treament, measured at 24 weeks.
└─ Plot_Figure_2EGF: load the raw data in data_voidarea_cells.mat, computes and plot the chefs shown in Fig 2E, F and G. Curves for the theoretical model can be obtained from running the scripts in Models/neutral_model (for 2F) and Models/non_neutral_model (for 2G).
