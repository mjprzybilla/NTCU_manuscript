# Figure 3 -  Single cell profiling reveals cellular transition in trachea following NTCU treatment.

**scRNA_01_scanpy_NTCU_GEX_analysis.ipynb** - Script to perform standard analysis workflow of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the trachea, including the sub-clustering of epithelial cells and scoring of publicly available gene signatures.

**scRNA_02_DESeq2_DEG_analysis.R** - Script to visualise and analyse DESeq2 analysis results from pseudo-bulk analysis performed on individual cell types in epithelial cells.

**scRNA_03_scCODA_NTCU_GEX_analysis.ipynb** - Script to perform differential abundance analysis with scCODA as well as collectTRI and dorothea analysis.
